2025-10-01 23:42:00.784 -03:00 [WRN] The 'ContactRelation' property 'Relation' on entity type 'Contact' is configured with a database-generated default, but has no configured sentinel value. The database-generated default will always be used for inserts when the property has the value 'familia', since this is the CLR default for the 'ContactRelation' type. Consider using a nullable type, using a nullable backing field, or setting the sentinel value for the property to ensure the database default is used when, and only when, appropriate. See https://aka.ms/efcore-docs-default-values for more information.
